My name is Markus Hartmann. I life in a small village near the German town Coblence with my wife and my little son.

At work I'm Manager of the PaaS-Unit. I am particularly committed to our DevOps-Toolings, Kubernetes-Platform and Identitymanagment systems. I love the agile mindset, but understand the needs of other methods to.

In my sparetime I get my hands dirty and do a lot of low level things. I like coding in Go, building Baremetal k8s-Cluster and deploying a lot of stuff to my arm64 nodes. Besides the IT I love running and biking, so when you are near, let me know - we can meet for a run ;-)

On my site you will the some content from my private and work experiences.
